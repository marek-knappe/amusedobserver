					<description><![CDATA[I agree with you--I don&#039;t think the type of accommodation defines what kind of a traveler someone is. I think it definitely depends on the traveler and it shouldn&#039;t be a competition!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve stayed in a few hostels in Europe and one in the US - all great places to meet people! However, as the other commenters said, as long as you are comfortable and seeing the world, who cares where you stay!]]></description>

My clothes are in a backpack only because it&#039;s easier for me to haul up the steps of metro stations and accommodations with no lifts. But we all have our opinions, ne? Thanks for sharing your article! Also - I&#039;m in a hostel right now, and I&#039;m starting to hate hostel life haha.]]></description>
