					<description><![CDATA[Love this! Thank you for sharing. I had a lot of people tell me similar things when I went to South Africa. There are all levels of accommodation, but it&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for + being open to the fact it won&#039;t be just like home (which is the whole point in going). When you say Africa a lot of people, who have never been, have this idea in their head on what it will be. Yes, some places have extreme poverty and it will open your eyes but not everywhere is like that. I loved my time in South Africa, and Morocco... would love to visit Tanzania at some point.

					<description><![CDATA[You are right i think most people put Africa in the too hard and basket and just move on to another continent  mainly Asia or Europe. The expectation of Africa is unrest as portrayed by the western media. Its a shame these countries could really do with the tourists. Some of the places you visited looked amazing I have always wanted to go to Zanzibar it sounds os exotic.]]></description>
