					<description><![CDATA[What do you think the high cost of spending holidays in Tanzania stem from? Is it more due to the fact that the attractions you listed are so popular or it&#039;s because it&#039;s just expensive to e.g. organise equipment for the Kili trekking or it takes a lot of driving, guiding to do the safari? Would you say the attractions are worth their price or are overpriced?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a very interesting percentage but I am wondering how much did you spend in the end? I would love to go to Tanzania but I don&#039;t know how much it would cost, that information would be very useful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is definitely a splurge and well worth it too I&#039;m sure. It&#039;s a good post to start the planning with what you must do, and then add in the other items based on splurges versus experience. I think street food is both... just not an expensive splurge!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good tip about traveling in a group to split the cost. If you can take a cab with someone, or maybe get a room and split the cost that should lower the cost somewhat. I bet the safari was fun, but in addition to paying for that experience, one still has to pay for the flights, which probably would be the biggest cost. Still, I bet it was unforgettable. Lucky you!]]></description>
