					<description><![CDATA[I think everyone has their own preferences. I hardly ever wear jeans if I&#039;m in warmer climates, I prefer workout type clothes. But I also never take old clothes because I don&#039;t want to look too bummy lol!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting perspective. Also about the jeans- I always carry at least two pairs because they help you blend in almost everywhere and can be dressed up and down. Yoga pants, not so much!]]></description>

And I do agree that jeans are comfortable and convenient, but only when traveling to non-tropical locations. I actually really love going into the countryside, but I don&#039;t think it is necessarily a more authentic experience than the cities...it is just different....]]></description>
