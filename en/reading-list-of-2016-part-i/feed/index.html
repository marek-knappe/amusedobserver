Well, yes, I landed at Teheran airport and then went by taxi to the bus terminal to go to Shiraz, so I don&#039;t count it as being in Teheran :) 
I was planning to see it on the way back, but I ran out of time, and then I went from Kashan straight to Teheran airport.]]></description>

I&#039;m looking forward to reading and relaxing again - I often feel I just don&#039;t have time in my typical day to day life!]]></description>
