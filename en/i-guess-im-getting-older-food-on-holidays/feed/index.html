Living in Asia, I became fussy and suddenly wanted to go to ‚Äúhigher-end‚Äù restaurants. Sort of, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence thing. I was always curious why there are some Michelin-stared restaurants in Lima. I guess been considered the best cuisine on the continent explains it.]]></description>
