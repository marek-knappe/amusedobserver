					<description><![CDATA[Travel will never be exactly how you expect it, and that is what makes it so special! I&#039;ve always wanted to see the Blue Hole myself, but you are right that sometimes the birds-eye views can be deceiving. I had a similar situation in Palau, with the Rock Islands. I love your photo of the flamingoes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is really interesting! I&#039;ve been to places where I was slightly disappointed, either because they definitely look much better on videos/photos or because they were a bit too crowded. One thing no one can replace is the experience of being there, that&#039;s priceless! I&#039;ve also been to places that surprised me and that I would love to go back.

I usually say any place is a good place to visit. Even it rains and the photos come out terrible.

That blue hole picture is amazing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Totally agree with you - we try and travel now with very little to no expectations, though it&#039;s very difficult when it comes to touristy well promoted locations. I&#039;ve found the destinations with the best reputations have always left me the most disappointed! Too high expectations and way too much hype in the lead up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can really relate to this post. Laughed out loud at the Blue Hole one especially. Such a long boat ride to get there too! Although, sometimes I feel like I do too much research about a place. So, if the place doesn&#039;t match my expectations I am disappointed even though there is really a lot to be excited about!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah ha ha. I laughed out loud when I saw your photo of Cminda Sameba Church in Georgia, and again with the sole flamingo. But isn&#039;t finding the real thing so worth it, warts and all? Except maybe that horrible looking meal. Ick.]]></description>
