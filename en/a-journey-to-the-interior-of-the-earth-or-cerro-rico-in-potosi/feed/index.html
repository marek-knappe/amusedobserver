Yes, it gives you a little bit of understanding, and you think how lucky you are to go there just for a moment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, this definitely sounds like an adventure. I&#039;m glad to hear you made it out ok. I think these kind of experiences are important, as much as they may not be totally enjoyable at the time. It&#039;s really the only way to fully appreciate and acknowledge the history of such a place. We were in Bolivia for 2 weeks but didn&#039;t manage to get to Potosi - I would definitely go back though to experience the mines firsthand.]]></description>
