					<description><![CDATA[Well, I don&#039;t know... I don&#039;t and wouldn&#039;t follow any of those advices, simply because I don&#039;t care what other people think concerning my trips. If people are worried, because they care about me like family and friends -  I&#039;m okay with that and I talk to them about their worries and would take them seriously. But in general, that wouldn&#039;t stop me. And I wouldn&#039;t make a great deal about it by telling them things like other places are worse etc. It&#039;s the way it is. 
And concerning all the other people: I don&#039;t care. But maybe this is just an age thing?]]></description>

Yes, I always get the questions about the next destination as well. Even my family doctor asks me that whenever she sees me :)]]></description>
