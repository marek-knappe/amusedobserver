					<description><![CDATA[I just experienced my first cooking class last month in Thailand and I loved it! It was so much fun to learn about local ingredients and to try  recipes that aren&#039;t always the norm. The only downside is that now all of my friends are expecting me to cook for them! ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh how I wish i could make ceviche and empanadas! I always feel that food tells a lot about a place so taking cooking lessons is the best way to get behind the scenes plus markets always make for a great trip. Love your hats ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t mind the wine tasting at the beginning either! :) Looks like a really fun class--I&#039;ve always wanted to take a class like this! Those empanadas look so delicious--would be a fun recipe to take home an know how to make for later!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Though I&#039;m not a huge fan of cooking at home, I love visiting markets, going on food tours, and participating in cooking classes when I travel. This one looks great. Too bad they made you spit out the wine in the beginning, but the dishes and the beverages in the end sounded like it was totally worth it! I think I&#039;d stick with wine over the pisco sour though!]]></description>
