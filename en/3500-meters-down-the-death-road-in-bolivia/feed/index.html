					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations! It looks scary. I am not sure I will want to do it! 
With all the thick mist, near zero invisibility  and the cold winds , 
brrrrrr...  I just love the last photo :)
And that video shows how dangerous it is!]]></description>

I&#039;ve heard many good and bad things about the ride and that&#039;s why I thought it was important to choose the reputable company with good bikes - I&#039;m really happy I did it!]]></description>

Well, first of all I was scared so all the time I pressed my hand breaks, and then because of rain - the faster I went the more spashes there -  and after some minutes of going really fast my sunglasses were all covered with mud so it was dangerous. I took them off, but then I still had problems because dirty water from the pools would get to my eyes and that was really uncomfortable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This looks awesome to me. So much adrenaline you sure had during the ride. I usually bike up first before I bike down, but still would love to do this. Probably a silly question from me, but 12km/hour average - was it because of the mud pools or you had some breaks?]]></description>
