					<description><![CDATA[Wow, a post painstakingly put together! Persian food is close to Lebanese food which my husband loves because his first wife (who has passed on) was Lebanese. Since he loves Lebanese food, I have tasted so much of it. All the things you put here look so good and yummy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I watched that episode of Anthony Bourdain and loved it! I would love to get to Iran for a taste of it&#039;s range of Persian cuisine. I can&#039;t believe people said you would get sick of kebabs! I&#039;ll have their leftovers!! Could never get sick of kebabs or soup!!

 The Zaratustrian Fire Festival sounds like it would have been a wonderful cultural experience. Sounds like you had a really fab time. 

Thanks for the cuisine guide - hopefully I can get there to experience it all first hand soon :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have never had Iranian food but from your pictures, feel quite sure I would be a big fan. I love all those great middle Eastern flavors and that soup, layered between the 2 kinds, is innovative and looks delicious! I love that they cook so many eggplants, love them and we don&#039;t use them nearly enough in the US.]]></description>
