					<description><![CDATA[Introverts renew and gain energy from being alone, while extroverts get their energy and renewal from being with others. That&#039;s why on fam trips introverts suffer, because while other people are relaxing in the evening by having long dinners and/or drinks, introverts find this down time exhausting. It&#039;s my one major problem with travelling in any kind of group, so I get where you&#039;re coming from. That said, the world would be lost without our friends, the extroverts!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty outgoing, but I like that when I travel I control the level and amount off my interactions with people -- both locals and other tourists. Sometimes during my travels I enjoy chattting with others (especially when I&#039;m at a karaoke venue), but at other times it&#039;s nice to just walk around on my own or observe my surroundings quietly. I always stay in hotels so I do have a lot of privacy when I want it. It&#039;s sometimes disappointing to me when I&#039;m in a country where I face a large language barrier (like recently in China, where few people spoke English), because then I can&#039;t choose very often to converse with locals even when I want to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am an introvert :) and I can subscribe to everything you wrote. Generally, there is a simplified opinion about introverts - they are asocial, period. This is not true at all. Observant, quiet[er] - yes. Personally, I like meeting new people and having conversations and learning from them, but not in loud, crowded settings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your point about online versus reality, though I think they may be one and the same just your reality is different from someone else that was there with you. That&#039;s the beauty of our individual minds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m an introvert as well, and thats why I love solo travel. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love travelling with other people as well, but I have a time limit of how much I can endure before I need my own space again.]]></description>
