					<description><![CDATA[WOW
LOVE those pics! Specially the one overlooking La Paz from above. 
Congrats on a great post and your thoughts about La Paz. I have a love-hate relationship with cities, still making up my mind around them :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, good thing she found out about the passports early on! I triple-check my passport before going anywhere as I&#039;m always afraid I&#039;ll take my husband&#039;s by mistake!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hii,

This was absolutely new place to me but your narration made me understand the spirit of the place. But i agree, in my case too , in a new city i feel at home usually during evening hours.

Thanks for sharing. Keep at it.

					<description><![CDATA[Oh dear! That could&#039;ve caused a few problems indeed if it only had been discovered at the airport!:-) 
Like you, I absolutely LOVE chaotic cities. I went to Vienna last year and didn&#039;t really like it coz it was all too &quot;clean and perfect&quot; I preferred the broken pavements of Bratislava, Slovakia, a few hours away!]]></description>
