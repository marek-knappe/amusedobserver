					<description><![CDATA[Great stats! I must say I&#039;m a bit surprised by the list of favorite countries. And I agree: how long you stay isn&#039;t the only thing that counts, it&#039;s more about what you get out of it while you&#039;re there!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Neat statistics! I agree that how long you stay in a certain country shouldn&#039;t solely dictate how well you &quot;know&quot; the country. Sometimes smaller experiences can go such a long way!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s so interesting! Europe and Asia have always been a hotbed for tourists but I agree the Africa is very much less-traveled. I&#039;m hoping to get around there soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought western people like to travel in Asia as Asians like to travel in the west? Guess I&#039;m wrong. I agree with what you said, it doesn&#039;t matter how long you stayed in a place, every travel counts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://marek-knappe.github.io/amusedobserver/en/2015-where-did-we-travel/#comment-6948&quot;&gt;Elaine J Masters&lt;/a&gt;.

Oh, Elaine, I think we all have cost cutting in mind! But you know, for me going to Americas is very very expensive - so it is for my friends, so most of us stick to Europe. 
I hope you&#039;ll enjoy your solo trip to Europe - actually I&#039;m also planning to explore more of Europe this year :)]]></description>
