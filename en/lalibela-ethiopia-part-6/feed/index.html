					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never even heard of Lalibela and it&#039;s &#039;underground&#039; churches. Thanks for introducing me. I was just in Siem Reap, Cambodia, and the children beggars were pretty over the top. It&#039;s sad... and hard to not give into wanting &#039;to help&#039;, but you&#039;re right, it only encourages the children to not go to school and and to stay on the streets begging, because they feel it&#039;s more lucrative.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have a bucket list but there are a few places that I would be so disappointed not seeing. The Church of St George is one of them. For years I&#039;ve been talking about going and you&#039;ve rekindled that passion to make it happen!]]></description>
