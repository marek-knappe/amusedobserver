					<description><![CDATA[&quot;People often mistake poverty, hardship and folklore with authenticity&quot; -- Couldn&#039;t agree with this more.  Take America for example, something close to home. It&#039;s like saying I visited the slums of Detroit and got a really good feel for &quot;America.&quot; In actuality, America is about freedom and individuals carving out success for themselves.  The slums of Detroit show nothing related to what America is about. I think authentic travel is really any sort of travel experience that allows you to glean essentially what a destination is all about and what makes it unique.

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, I totally agree so many people think that to be authentic they have to go the the poor areas, or have a rustic looking accommodation that&#039;s more often than not totally set-up for tourists and not actually real. I think to look for  think to get an authentic experience you need to go to the places that the locals live, eat and spend their time. I love staying with locals through AirBnb, or local schemes and always look to stay in areas that locals live rather than that the tourists visit. My favourite experiences are usually where we&#039;ve interacted with the people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Totally agree with standards of living varying wildly. For me, I always find the experience more &quot;authentic&quot; when I get to interact with the locals, they&#039;re often moments I think back to the most, such as random acts of kindness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hear hear! I get annoyed too at the so-called &#039;search for the authentic&#039;, which so many people assume means going back to basics, hardship and rural areas. We stayed for a week in Luang Prabang last year, and whilst we loved it, others moaned that it was no longer &#039;authentic&#039; because it was no longer full of farmers ploughing paddy fields, and shock horror, the locals were actually enjoying advancements in 21st technology and commerce rather than living in the past. So great post, and couldn&#039;t agree more!]]></description>
