					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ve just got back from the Masai Mara, Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater and I thought the lions were the stars of the show! I didn&#039;t realise how hard it would be to see them sometimes, the guides definitely have great eye sight! And wow how cool that they came so close to your car! Great photos - I really enjoyed reading this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had no idea that Simba was how you say â€˜lionâ€™ in Swahili!!! Makes total sense that that&#039;s the name they would have adopted for the Disney film though!! You have spectacular photography - took me straight back to our own trip through the Serengeti :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow such beautiful animals. I would love to do a lion safari and see these beauties. Also, in the film, everything happens very fast in the first few seconds. Does he kill the other lion?]]></description>
