					<description><![CDATA[As a previous commenter stated they are also great to use for storing dirty laundry between trips to a washing machine. I used them last time we went to europe. I must say not sure they save any space but they are great for organizing clothes into different bags]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I asked myself this same question as well when I was thinking of buying some. I should have read your post way before and it could have saved me the headache of researching haha. But you really raised some great points and right now my packing cubes help me a TON too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m quite the organiser, and this looks right up my alley! I especially agree on it being useful in backpacks, it would be great if things would stay organised in them. I always waste time digging through mine and messing everything up in the process! These seem like such a simple but effective idea :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a very similar experience to you.  I was pretty skeptical about packing cubes at first and decided to give them a try anyway.  Now I swear by them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to be part of the group who thought packing cubes were a waste of money! But Oh God, how I was wrong!!!
Beginning of this year my husband decided to by 3 packing cubes for him, and I love, so a stole them for me! As you said everything are so much more organize, I travel with a backpack and they help a lot to keep everything in place. Specially for us, woman, that carry small clothes like tops, bar, skirts,.. you ca fit so much in only on cube. Amazing!
Cheers!
