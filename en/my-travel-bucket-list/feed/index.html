					<description><![CDATA[What a lovely list. The ones that most tug at my wanderlust are &quot;See Vanilla Grow&quot; and Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia. Very satisfying to see these checked off!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are absolutely right . One can&#039;t visit all the places on earth. I have been to many countries but am yet to explore India itself fully. I do have list of places I want to visit but it keeps changing every few months and mostly it keeps growing!]]></description>
