					<description><![CDATA[Well, this 6 kilos is what mules are supposed to carry. You carry your small backpack and I guess you can put as much as you want inside - if you&#039;re able to carry more, no problem :) but most people try to limit it as much as possible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loved this article, it reminded me of my climb of Salkantay. If I remember well, I think I did it with the same tour company and we were only 3 in the group: me and a professional Swiss hiking couple. I was always left behind and I struggled a lot, managing to hike for 3 days with a mini whole in the back of my knee. I took the car from Santa Teresa to the Hydroelectrica because I couldn&#039;t walk anymore. This year I am going back to Peru and I am contemplating if I should give this trek another go, now that I am properly trained for hiking. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s too bad you got sick. I&#039;m glad you stuck with it though! I would have liked to do a trek to Machu Picchu too, but when I went I didn&#039;t have much time, so I took a train from Cusco. Wasn&#039;t Machu Picchu spectacular though?! I loved it. :)]]></description>
