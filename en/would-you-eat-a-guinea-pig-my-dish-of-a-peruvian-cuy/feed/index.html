					<description><![CDATA[I love to try new dishes. I think if I&#039;d have seen the live guinea pig before eating, I couldn&#039;t have tried it, but I&#039;d like to think I&#039;d give it a go otherwise. Great post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Given the opportunity I would eat cuy too. Trying out regional dishes is a huge part of travel! I actually had no idea that people eat guinea pigs anywhere in the world, so thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad to hear that you&#039;re open to new experiences - I would dfeinitely give it a go, even if I am a little adverse to eating a childhood pet!!! But when it omes down to it it&#039;s all about immersing yourself in someone elses culture and stepping outside your comfort zone to try something new. And you never truly experience life unless you&#039;re open to new adventures. So I would definitely be all in :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always like trying new things when travelling abroad and during my time here in China i&#039;ve been able to try a few weird things but not sure if I would eat Guinea Pigs especially if they&#039;re in the cage in the store!]]></description>
