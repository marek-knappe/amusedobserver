					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing this fascinating story. I&#039;m going to watch this movie, even though I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll get very depressed afterwards. I admire women who fight for their rights in spite of the unbelievable risks they face. What if we lived there? I ask myself the same question every time I see less fortunate people than us. There is so much room for worse in our lives...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am happy that women in Timbuktu are being brave and fighting back. I am on my way to Pakistan and can&#039;t help of think of the same. What if I lived there? What if I can&#039;t watch TV, listen to the radio or wear whatever I like? What if I won&#039;t be able to see the sun because I am required to completely cover myself? Thanks for sharing your thoughts. It&#039;s nice to see other female bloggers raising awareness on this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Beautiful thoughts I couldn&#039;t agree more with. I have not watched the movie but I have lived, traveled and worked in Africa, in many of the conservative countries like Sudan or Nigeria and  day to day life is not always like the press makes us believe. It is true, freedom for women may be very limited in some places, but we also fail to understand, from the West, that they were raised to think that was normal and that, usually, what makes us unhappy is to know there is something better. I always wanted to go to Timbuktu, particularly to the Desert festival that took place every other year. It has been cancelled and I am not sure I will ever make it there. But it will forever remain a place far away, one that describes a time when Africa was at the peak]]></description>
