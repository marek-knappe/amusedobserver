					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoen/why-are-you-going-there/#comment-9608&quot;&gt;salini&lt;/a&gt;.

I haven&#039;t thought of going to India yet, I&#039;m a little bit afraid of too many people - as all my friends&#039; photos show that. Unfortunately, I&#039;m not also a big fan of Indian cuisine. 
But I&#039;ll go one day - I&#039;m sure of that - just to check out for myself. Generally, when I listen to my friends I have an impresson that you either love this country or hate it - it doesn&#039;t leave anyone indifferent ;) ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You should definitely give Malaysia another chance - Kuala Lumpur is great, but there are so many other beautiful areas of the country. Maybe spend a few nights and relax at one of the oceanfront or island luxury resorts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As many of you said, even I did search for my country first. India. Just was curious to know what would attract you to India.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoen/why-are-you-going-there/#comment-9606&quot;&gt;Earth&#039;s Attractions&lt;/a&gt;.

I almost went to Romania this year, but then I decided to travel in my own country. Lots of my friends visited Romania though, and everybody said it&#039;s a great country so one day I&#039;ll go for sure!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I admit that the first thing I did was to check and see if my country (Romania) is on your list. It is not - but who knows, maybe it will be in the future. Then I start to read the article and loved the honesty and the simple things that made you pick one place or another (the neighbors suggesting different places, for instance). All in all, this is the spirit! And some travels are meant to help us learn a new language (or practice - I saw you chose some for learning Spanish) or something else, others are for fun. But each experience enriches us.]]></description>
