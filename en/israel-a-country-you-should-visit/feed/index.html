					<description><![CDATA[Israel tops in my list of dream destinations. 
The mix of cultures, the old lanes there and their food... these things tempt me.
You got some great frames from there though I would love to see more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d love to visit Israel. I think it would be culturally fascinating. I have floated in the Dead Sea in Jordan and loved exploring that country. Next time I&#039;m in the region, I&#039;ll definitely try and squeeze in a trip to Israel. I believe you should not have your passport stamped if you want to visit other countries in the Middle East. Is that right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never visited Israel, though it&#039;s on my list. I&#039;d love to travel there. I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s extremely vegan friendly, which is definitely helpful for my travels!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Definitely agree--unexpected and unplanned trips are always so great because you don&#039;t have expectations! Looks like it ended up being a great trip. I always love visiting places from movies and books and Israel would be a super interesting place for that. The Dead Sea would be cool to check out too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What an amazing place.  I am heading to Egypt and Jordan next year and was wandering whether to do Israel too.  I think you should convinced me!]]></description>
