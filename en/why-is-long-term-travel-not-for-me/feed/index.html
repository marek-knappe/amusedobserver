					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your honest account on this. I totally understand and respect your sentiments. I am a long-term traveler and it works well for me. I am glad you found the type of traveler that you are because it&#039;s really important to do something that fits our taste. Some people just force it and it backfires during the trip. Thanks again for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Each to their own, everyone should live their lives the way they want and makes them happy.  Although we are full time travelers I can&#039;t stand bloggers and others telling people what is right or wrong.  Full time travel is not for everyone, it is not always easy or fun. The trick is finding out what makes you happy, and it sounds like you definitely have figured out what makes you happy and how you like to live you life, and that is awesome! Most people never figure it out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am in agreeance with you on this one. Our typical trip is 10 days in length. While I often wish we had a few more days each time, I don&#039;t want to go to traveling months at a time, unless we&#039;re actually just temporarily living somewhere instead of traveling non-stop. I&#039;d love to stay somewhere longer term and really get to know it and live there, but I&#039;m not too keen on living out of a suitcase and hotels for much longer than a couple weeks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Long term travel is certainly not for everyone.   I love to travel and do it often, but I also love having a house and dogs.  It&#039;s all about finding a balance that works for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bravo. I love traveling and have been on the road this year (mostly work related) almost as much as I&#039;m at home. I miss friends and not speaking the language is excruciating. I&#039;m forever starting conversations with people and when I couldn&#039;t the walls between us loomed large.]]></description>
