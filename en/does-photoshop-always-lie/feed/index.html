					<description><![CDATA[Saturation is one of my biggest pet peeves, I often see overly-saturated photos on Instagram and it makes me want to scream.  I&#039;ve always seen editing photos just like developing a film. Our cameras edit the photos from the moment we press the shutter button, why not editing them the way we remember the scene? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting point! I agree with you--sometimes a photo needs to be adjusted to make it look a bit more like the scene was in real life, especially if the photo is underexposed or something isn&#039;t set quite right when taking the photo.  I always hate crooked horizons, too! That one always gets me!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with skewed horizons annoying the life out of me - something that can be so easily corrected and doesn&#039;t alter the shot at all (after all the photographer was probably holding the camera at an angle - rather than the world being ON that odd angle!) - so all for making that adjustment. Saturation I can take or leave, some shots I really appreciate the bold colours - others, it just looks silly! But each to their own, after all if they are your own photos, they should be all about what you like and what you saw - and nobody can take that away from you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This discussion will go on for ages. Is it wrong or is it right? That depends on the individual and like they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder! If you have three people take the same photo you will see it presented in three different ways. Now, who is to say that each one is not the reality of the photographer? Like everything else there is the good side and the bad side. Photoshop is a great tool, especially for creating effects. How you chose to use it is your decision.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Photoshop is a lie. I&#039;ve worked as a photo retoucher for a few years and while, yes, in some cases it IS used to skew the reality, for the most part, Photoshop is to digital photography what dark room development and printing is to analog photography. An image straight out of the camera is like a negative, it needs some minor adjustment to come to life. For me, it&#039;s a little sharpening, some white balance, contrast and saturation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[good post! I am sometimes too lazy to adjust my photos with photoshop, but I do it most of the time. I agree we show the reality, but we cold adjust the shot by camera or photoshop. The tram pic reminds me a photo I took in Milan.  I did the same I remove unnesseracy objects from the photo by cropping.]]></description>
