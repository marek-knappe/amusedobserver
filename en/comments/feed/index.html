					<description><![CDATA[Hi&#039;!
Came across your post when searching on Pinterest. I am going on Friday, a spontaneous decision we just took today! We live just beside the border to Bolivia, it&#039;s low season and we got a cheap tour of 4 days, so I am trying now to prepare myself (a thing that I never usually do). Thanks for tips!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[some great quotes here travel truly is inspiring for making quotes. What i dont like is when quotes try and distinguish betreen travellers and people on vacation. In the end we are all getting out there to see new things and that inspires wanderlust in us all]]></description>
