					<description><![CDATA[I think that this is a fabulous suggestion! I studied Spanish in school but left without being able to have even a descent conversation. Years later I spent months in South America, and still had trouble picking it up. I think it&#039;s incredibly helpful to take a class while you are immersed in the language. Thanks so much for the recommendation on this specific class, as well as living with a family. I love this idea!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did something similar in Valencia, Spain. I agree that it is such a great way to learn the language and feel like a local! I would love to go to Bolivia one day. Perhaps I can take a refresher course in Spanish while we&#039;re there!]]></description>
