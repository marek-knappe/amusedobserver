					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, altitude sickness is rather high price to pay when you&#039;re so high up in the mountains. But, as mountain landscape junkie, I think it&#039;s still worth it. The views on such altitude are breathtaking!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad you recovered &quot;quickly&quot;! I&#039;ve never experienced altitude sickness although I&#039;ve had some heavier breathing issues at 3800 but they went away after a few minutes.

Planning on going next year to 5800, so I&#039;ll definitely remember to be ready!

Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve ever experienced altitude sickness - as I&#039;ve never been too high up. But, at least it only lasted that one day! I can&#039;t imagine going on the trek and having it every day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow. I&#039;m not huge on hiking and I only ever hike baby mountains (if they can even be called that...probably more like hills hahaa), so altitude sickness has never even crossed my mind. But, now I see it&#039;s real. Yikes! I&#039;ll definitely keep it in mind if I ever decide to tackle a real mountain. So glad you&#039;re ok.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One cannot underestimate the impact of altitude. When we got to Machu Picchu, we survived on coca tea to keep up with the altitude. Have never heard altitude sickness described and it sounds quite severe! Glad to to hear that you survived and were able to enjoy your trek.]]></description>
