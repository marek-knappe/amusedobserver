					<description><![CDATA[This list is superfun, pretty sure didn&#039;t know quite a few of them existed before I read them here :) Also I think some of them are known by different names  here in India . Graycation or 3 generations of family travelling together is known as Genercation or so I read somewhere. Anyhow a very cool list to bookmark :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I gotta say, it&#039;s so interesting to read the glossary of modern tourism, some I&#039;ve already encountered in the past, the other I just learned of now, like Champing. I didn&#039;t know you could camp in a church.

Reading this I think I am a cross breed of backpacker and flashpacker. I should call myself backflashpacker joke! Hahaha....]]></description>
