					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://marek-knappe.github.io/amusedobserver/en/iran-how-much-does-it-cost/#comment-8371&quot;&gt;Trisha Velarmino - P.S. I&#039;m On My Way&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, I would go backpacking solo in Iran if I didn&#039;t have the company. Actually, it was my initial plan to do it, but then a friend joined.
My blogger friend went solo however, and she wrote about her experience here: http://www.mywanderlust.pl/solo-female-travel-in-iran/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow. Thank you for this. I&#039;ve been so curious about Iran and its neighbouring countries. I&#039;m not the type to get easily discouraged with risks but I know I need to be practical and set forth my concerns. Would it be accommodating to a solo female traveller? I would really love to go back packing in this beautiful country. I am just so curious.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow what a useful list, thank you! These tips and records are very helpful when deciding on a place to go. Iran&#039;s architecture is stunning, the colours and those pillars are just beautiful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this breakdown - I think that&#039;s actually pretty reasonable vacation. We&#039;re also one&#039;s to never economize on food; sure, a lot of the time it can probably be done a lot cheaper, but for us it&#039;s about striking the balance of not missing out on experiences and immersing ourselves fully just because we want to save as much as possible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I am not the only one who keeps track of what they spend!! Actually, one of the things I didn&#039;t realise was just how cheap the flight was. It&#039;s made me want to organise a trip later this year now!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Iran is so high on our list of places we want to see. I&#039;ve read it is valuable to take a guided tour, but I see here that you only hired a guide on occasion. Do you speak any of the language? Find any uncomfortable moments as a woman?

And who wrote the quote at the end about boring trips and boring travelers? It is my new favorite quote!!!]]></description>
