					<description><![CDATA[Amazing photos! WOW! How cool is that?! I remember when I went on my first safari back in 2006, my photos were absolutely beyond rubbish haha! Out of focus and you could barely recognize that what I had photographed was an elephant...LOL. I wish I had seen the hippos too....how funny they look with their mouths wide open. I really miss Africa now. Spent three years of my life there and there is simply no place like it. Although I am sure Tanzania must be very different in many ways to Namibia!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You did not expect much but it seems you have gained a lot from the trip. It is even more wonderful as you did not expect to to such a thing with lot of obstacles. I might keep this in mind as prepare to visit Tanzania ;-)]]></description>

I hope you&#039;ll enjoy your safari! 
Because of the expenses  I&#039;m not likely to do it again in the near future, but I hope that one day I&#039;ll experience it again :)]]></description>
