					<description><![CDATA[yuuummmmm this makes my mouth water (I am a huge seafood lover) and it is also bringing me on a trip down memory lane as I visit Portugal many years ago and loved everything about the country, including the food! I remember the sardines and bachalau but I had never heard of chicken fish.... Not sure it would be my favourite thing either, I prefer fish grilled. I am hoping to visit Lisbon in December and if I do  I&#039;ll come back to comment again and let you know what I tried :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love seafood and octopus, this is a great guide. The reason why you often come across octopus being chewy is people do not tenderize it or boil it enough. Monkfish is another favorite of mine!]]></description>
