					<description><![CDATA[Love this. I like to say that only boring people get bored. If someone is bored when they are traveling (or at home or doing anything else) then they need to change how they approach travel or whatever it is they&#039;re doing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I so totally agree with you. You nailed it! With every new place I go, I appreciate what I see and experience more and more. Everything depends on attitude and expectations. One thing that bothers me these days is that people forgot (or never even realized) the primary purpose of travel. Instead of learning, experiencing new cultures, broadening horizons, seemingly, all they care about is to snap a photo (in many cases selfie) and rush to the next landmark.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How can travel not change a bad mood to a good one? :)
Nicely thought of and all good considerations...as much as we would like to be unplanned, every destination matters too much to go unplanned for now. 
Cheers :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great post. Every city has a personality and sometimes you just don&#039;t click.  I have friends who actually didn&#039;t like Paris or don&#039;t like New York.  Is it because of the hype or maybe they just didn&#039;t click with that city]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Completely agree! Absolutely love this post. Trying not to compare places is one of the best things you can do in my opinion--yes, you may like one place more than another, but if you are focused on comparisons, you won&#039;t see the place you are in for what it really is. Throwing all comparisons and preconceived notions out the window helps you focus on the beauty of the place you are in. Love the tip about thinking of the day of the week too--that&#039;s an important one that can make such a huge difference!]]></description>
