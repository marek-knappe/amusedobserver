					<description><![CDATA[Love your honesty. You voiced what everyone has. Things they want, didn&#039;t achieve and did achieve. I love your willingness to admit you&#039;re not going to necessarily work towards the same things in 2016. It seems you will come up with some pretty awesome things no matter what this year by just being and accepting yourself! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha this is brilliant! The perfect antidote to reading how successful everyone else&#039;s 2015s were when in reality, mine was similar to yours but was still wonderfully fun :D.

I&#039;ll be joining you on the not studying languages, although I&#039;m full of good intentions too!]]></description>

I just got back from Mexico and am really starting to feel like I need to spend the time to learn it. Although that might only happen if I move somewhere where I&#039;m forced to learn it.]]></description>
